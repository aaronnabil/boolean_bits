# boolean_bits
Bit logic breadboard compatible modules

This project is based on [Dave's Boolean Bits](https://hackaday.io/project/21660-daves-boolean-bits) which I got from [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/prpplague/daves-boolean-bits/) but is now longer available for sale.

## Objectives

- PBC compatible with CNC fabrication
- Breadboard compatible
- Designed in KiCAD
- Modules and panel shared on Oshpark, with BOM from Digikey
- Textile/sewable version, similar footprint to [Adafruit's sewable neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-rgb-smart-pixels)
- Quad 2 input version, adders and other basic blocks ideal for teaching.

## Use

This modules are perfect for teaching logic before starting with FPGAs.

## TODO

- [ ] Test size of component and breadboard 2.54mm tolerance
- [ ] Build and test prototype
